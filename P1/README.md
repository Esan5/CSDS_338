# Project 1

Two projects were done, a scheduler and a threading project.

The scheduler simulates FIFO, SRTF, priority, round-robin by task, round-robin by queue, and weighted round-robin scheduling algorithms. The threading project uses threads to write to a file in order to compare the costs of using and not using mutex locks.
